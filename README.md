Analysing-Portuguese-Real-Estate-Market
In this project we have used our web scraping expertise to analyze the differences in property prices and current market demand across the six major cities in Portugal.


We gathered data from one of the most popular online marketplace in Portugal i.e. "olx.pt". This website is popular as it allows both the buyers and the sellers to interact at the same platform. We collected the data of houses available such as property title, price, size, date of advertisement.
After cleaning the data and visualization we could analyse and draw insights on the housing market in the various cities.
